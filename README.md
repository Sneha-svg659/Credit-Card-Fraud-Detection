# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques on imbalanced datasets.

## Objective
To classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate while minimizing false positives.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and normalization  
2. Handling class imbalance  
3. Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
4. Performance evaluation using precision and recall  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

## Results
The models effectively identify fraudulent transactions while handling class imbalance.

## Future Improvements
- Try ensemble and anomaly detection techniques  
- Apply SMOTE or advanced sampling methods  
- Deploy as a real-time detection system
